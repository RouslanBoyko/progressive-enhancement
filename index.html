            <h2>The story</h2>
            <p>
                Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.<br>
                They said,"We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate."  The farmer said, <em>Maybe.</em> <br>
                The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
                "Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!" The farmer again said, <strong>Maybe.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
                <br>
                The neighbors then said, "Oh dear, that’s too bad," and the farmer responded, <em>Maybe.</em> <br>
                The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
                <br>
                Again all the neighbors came around and said, "Isn’t that great!" Again, he said, <strong>Maybe.</strong>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens
                in it is good or bad <br> Because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
                you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.
                <br>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <q>
            Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys,
            but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
